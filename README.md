##  Basic-C-ASCII-Minesweeper-Game
Simple version of the classic Minesweeper game made in C. Includes difficulty modifiers. Maybe I'll update for a better interface. For university project ONLY

Please compile the C file and run in console.

The player is able to choose between easy, medium and hard diffiiculties. The objective is to click on all non-bomb cells while avoiding the bomb cells. The player can also flag/unflag any cell they suspect is a bomb.
Included is the documentation containing the variables, libraries, and functions used.
